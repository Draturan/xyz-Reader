>This repository was forked as the starter code for the XYZ Reader project in Udacity's Android Nanodegree.

This project is developed as an exercise for Udacity's Scholarship program (Nanodegree Android Developer).<br/>
The goal for this project was to correct and implement missing parts by using good practices and improved graphics styles using Material Design principles.

This app utilizes `Material Design principles`: this includes consistent and meaningful use of `Material Design UI` `components`, `fonts`, `color`, `motion` and `surfaces`.
